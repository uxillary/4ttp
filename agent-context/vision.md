# 4ttp – Four-Tier Temporal Protocol

## High-Level Concept

4ttp is a browser-based interactive simulation game where factions, represented as elemental/technological forces, compete and coexist within a digital battlefield.  
The player’s role is to intervene in the simulation by spawning entities, boosting factions, slowing opponents, or unleashing chaotic disruptions.  

The goal is twofold:

- **Balance Mode:** Maintain harmony and keep all factions alive for as long as possible.
- **Domination Mode:** Guide one faction to total dominance over the system.

Each playthrough generates a unique outcome log, presented as system readouts, cryptic prophecies, or AI-narrated voice lines.

## Player Experience

- **Tone:** Calm and hypnotic by default, but capable of spiraling into chaos based on the player’s choices.  
- **Session Length:** Short, 2–10 minute runs. Replayable with variations each time.  
- **Agency:** Players can meaningfully intervene every few seconds through abilities, not just passive observation.  
- **Rewards:**
  - Points scored for time survived and interventions used effectively.
  - Achievements tied to both balance and domination paths.
  - Endgame outcomes styled as “logs” or “prophecies” tied to the player’s actions.

## Identity & Style

- **Presentation:** A fusion of elemental archetypes and technological framing.  
  - Example: Fire becomes “Thermal Protocol,” Water becomes “Liquid Node.”  
- **Visuals:** Neon simulation grid, glowing entities, glitch text overlays.  
- **Audio:**
  - Calm ambient synths during balance.
  - Distorted pulses and impact SFX when chaos escalates.
  - Distinct sound signatures per faction and per conversion event.

## Chroma Awards Alignment

- **Browser-based, no download, no login.** Exported as an HTML5 build and hosted on Itch.io.  
- **Interactivity:** Player-driven interventions ensure it isn’t just a simulation toy.  
- **AI Integration:**  
  - ElevenLabs for voice-based logs/prophecies.  
  - Optional AI-generated visual textures or prophecies to expand replay depth.  
- **Short Sessions:** Each run can be completed in <10 minutes.  
- **Sponsor Visibility:** Tools listed in project description, Chroma Awards logo included.

## Future Potential

While the MVP will use 3 factions (Fire/Thermal, Water/Liquid, Earth/Core), the system is designed to expand up to 7 factions with unique rules and interactions.  
This expansion introduces new layers of complexity, replayability, and storytelling depth while preserving the hypnotic yet chaotic core of 4ttp.
