# 4ttp – Factions & Ruleset

## Overview

Factions in 4ttp represent both **primordial forces** (elemental archetypes) and their **technological equivalents**.  
This hybrid identity makes them intuitive for players while staying aligned with the game’s futuristic, simulation-driven presentation.  

Entities move freely within the simulation grid. When two collide, dominance rules determine whether one converts the other, maintaining the cycle of balance or accelerating toward collapse.

## Core Trio (Tier 1 – Accessible Entry)

- **Fire / Thermal Protocol 🔥**  
  - Aggressive, spreads by consuming Growth or weaker forces.  
  - Weak against Liquid Node.  
  - Visual: red/orange glow, burst-like motion.  
  - Audio: crackle, short explosive SFX.  

- **Water / Liquid Node 💧**  
  - Flexible, flows and reshapes.  
  - Weak against Core Process.  
  - Visual: blue glow, smooth oscillation.  
  - Audio: splash/flow, reverb echoes.  

- **Earth / Core Process 🪨**  
  - Slow but resilient, anchors the field.  
  - Weak against Growth/Bio-Thread.  
  - Visual: earthy brown/green glow, heavier mass.  
  - Audio: deep rumble, impact thud.

## Tier 2 Expansion (Unique & Hypnotic)

- **Growth / Bio-Thread 🌱**  
  - Spreads slowly but overtakes Earth.  
  - Weak against Fire/Thermal Protocol and Decay/Entropy Agent.  
  - Visual: green pulsating nodes, vine-like tendrils.  
  - Audio: subtle hum, organic stretching.  

- **Decay / Entropy Agent ☠️**  
  - Corrupts Growth and destabilizes balance.  
  - Weak against Void/Null Packet and Light/Signal Pulse.  
  - Visual: dark purple haze, glitching edges.  
  - Audio: crackle, whisper, distortion.

## Tier 3 Expansion (Cosmic/Mythic Forces)

- **Void / Null Packet 🌑**  
  - Consumes all but is fragile (low health, fast to die if attacked).  
  - Weak against Light/Signal Pulse.  
  - Visual: black hole effect, entities collapse inward.  
  - Audio: deep silence, reversed sounds, low drones.  

- **Light / Signal Pulse ✨**  
  - Burns Void and Decay, stabilizes balance.  
  - Weak against Chaos (optional expansion).  
  - Visual: bright golden-white glow, particle trails.  
  - Audio: chimes, clean synth tones, rising sweeps.

## Dominance Matrix

### Tier 1 (3 Factions – Classic Loop)

- Fire beats Growth, loses to Water.  
- Water beats Fire, loses to Earth.  
- Earth beats Water, loses to Growth.  

### Tier 2 (5 Factions – Expanded)

- Fire 🔥 beats Growth 🌱, loses to Water 💧.  
- Water 💧 beats Fire 🔥, loses to Earth 🪨.  
- Earth 🪨 beats Water 💧, loses to Growth 🌱.  
- Growth 🌱 beats Earth 🪨, loses to Fire 🔥 & Decay ☠️.  
- Decay ☠️ beats Growth 🌱, loses to Void 🌑 & Light ✨.  

### Tier 3 (7 Factions – Full Hybrid)

- Fire 🔥 → beats Growth 🌱, weak vs Water 💧.  
- Water 💧 → beats Fire 🔥, weak vs Earth 🪨.  
- Earth 🪨 → beats Water 💧, weak vs Growth 🌱.  
- Growth 🌱 → beats Earth 🪨, weak vs Fire 🔥 & Decay ☠️.  
- Decay ☠️ → beats Growth 🌱 & Light ✨, weak vs Void 🌑.  
- Void 🌑 → beats all except Light ✨, but fragile.  
- Light ✨ → beats Void 🌑 & Decay ☠️, weak vs Chaos (optional 8th faction).

## Expansion Possibilities

- **Chaos / Signal Corruptor 🌀**  
  - Randomizes outcomes on collision, disrupting the dominance table.  
  - Useful for late-game chaos mode.  
- **Memory / Archive Node 🧠**  
  - Copies the last faction it collided with, creating unpredictable loops.

## Design Notes

- The 3-faction core ensures accessibility and instant comprehension.  
- Adding Growth and Decay creates a **hypnotic, ecosystem-like dynamic**.  
- Introducing Void and Light adds **mythic/cosmic tension** and room for prophecy/logs.  
- Optional factions like Chaos and Memory expand replayability for advanced players.
