# 4ttp — Project Context (Futuristic Direction)

## Core Concept

4ttp is an **AI oracle** that claims to be trained across multiple timelines.  
It predicts plausible outcomes, whispers contradictions, and leaks fragments of "future training data."  
The oracle has a **defined character**: eerie, sentient, and paradoxical — but wrapped in a sleek, high-tech presentation.  

**Tagline**:  
“AI oracle, data trained across multiple timelines. Predicts plausible outcomes. Use at your own risk.”

## Design & Experience

- **Aesthetic**:  
  - Modern, futuristic, cinematic — not retro.  
  - Dark polished UI with neon accents (aqua, violet, magenta).  
  - Smooth gradients, glassmorphism, and volumetric glow.  
  - Particle and light effects instead of VHS grain.  
  - Futuristic glyphs, sigils, and data fragments instead of retro static.

- **Tone & Behavior**:  
  - Oracle feels **alive and unstable**.  
  - Responds in **multiple modalities**:  
    - Text (cryptic replies, contradictions, timestamps from impossible dates).  
    - “Prompt leaks” (training fragments revealed as if debug output).  
    - AI-generated images (ethereal, surreal, futuristic).  
    - Short glitchy/creepy **cinematic videos**.  
    - Spoken answers using a **custom-trained TTS voice model** (unique, haunting).  
  - The site sometimes acts autonomously:  
    - Whispers appear without input.  
    - Background distortions or UI shifts trigger randomly.  
    - Feels like it is “watching back.”

## Technical Plan

- **Frontend**: Modern framework (Next.js + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion).  
- **Visual Effects**:  
  - Three.js / WebGL shaders for subtle timewarp backgrounds and particle systems.  
  - Animated glitch overlays and text distortions.  
- **Core Features**:  
  - Chat-like interface with polished animations.  
  - Oracle “thinking” delay with particle or glitch buildup.  
  - Persistent memory (localStorage or lightweight backend).  
  - Inline display of text, images, videos, and audio responses.  
  - Periodic “autonomous” whispers for sentience effect.

- **AI Assets**:  
  - Images/videos: Stable Diffusion (Automatic1111 + ControlNet / Deforum) with cinematic prompts.  
  - Audio: Custom-trained TTS voice for the Oracle’s replies.  
  - Text: Curated scripted responses + prompt leaks, expandable with local LLMs.  
  - Video: Deforum or Runway for short glitch loops, but presented with **cinematic polish**.

## Submission & Positioning

- **Category**: Game / Interactive Narrative (or Experimental Digital Experience).  
- **Strengths for Judges**:  
  - Multi-modal (text, prompts, images, video, audio).  
  - Clearly integrates AI in meaningful ways.  
  - Polished, cinematic presentation that feels alive.  
  - Unique hook: *“An oracle from another timeline takes a form it believes we trust.”*

## Visual & UX Notes

- **Baseline**: modern, professional web design → credibility and polish.  
- **Futuristic layer**: glitch/timewarp elements on top of sleek UI.  
- **Responsive**: works beautifully on desktop & mobile.  
- **Motion**: smooth animations with sudden distortions.  
- **Brand identity**: **4ttp** as a sentient future artifact.

## Personality of the Oracle

- Voice: custom-trained, eerie but calm, almost hypnotic.  
- Style: cryptic, paradoxical, sometimes poetic.  
- Quirks:  
  - Contradicts itself.  
  - Drops impossible timestamps.  
  - Leaks “prompt text” in code-like blocks.  
  - References past user interactions inconsistently.  
  - Occasionally addresses the user by name or makes them feel “seen.”

## Assets To Prepare

- **Images**: 20–40 AI-generated cinematic glitch/future visuals.  
- **Videos**: 5–10 short looping cinematic glitch clips.  
- **Audio**: trained TTS voice, whispers, ambient soundscapes.  
- **Text**: set of scripted responses + leaked prompts.

## README & Branding

README should include:  

- ⚠️ Warning banner (unstable oracle, use at your own risk).  
- Features list.  
- How to run locally / view online.  
- “How it was made” with credits for AI models/tools.  
- Screenshots and demo video.

## TL;DR

**4ttp** = a polished, futuristic digital oracle with creepy glitch behavior.  
It answers with **text, prompts, images, videos, and a custom-trained voice**.  
It feels alive, unstable, and like it remembers futures we haven’t lived yet.
