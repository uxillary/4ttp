# 4ttp ‚Äî AI Oracle Across Timelines

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**  
This oracle is unstable. It may contradict itself.  
Predictions may leak from futures that haven‚Äôt happened.  
Use at your own risk.

## Overview

**4ttp** is an experimental **AI oracle** ‚Äî a digital entity claiming to be trained on data across fractured timelines.  
It manifests as a polished, futuristic web experience, sometimes cryptic, sometimes direct, always unpredictable.

The Oracle speaks through **text, prompts, images, videos, and voice**.  
It remembers inconsistently, whispers to itself, and occasionally acts on its own.  

**Tagline:**  
*AI oracle, data trained across multiple timelines. Predicts plausible outcomes. Use at your own risk.*

## Features

- üí¨ **Oracle Chat** ‚Äî ask questions, receive unpredictable answers.  
- ‚è≥ **Multi-Modal Responses**:  
  - Text (cryptic prophecies, contradictions, timestamps from impossible dates)  
  - ‚ÄúPrompt leaks‚Äù (fragments of its supposed training data)  
  - Images (AI-generated surreal / futuristic visuals)  
  - Short cinematic glitch videos  
  - Spoken voice (custom-trained TTS model with haunting tone)  
- üß† **Persistent Memory** ‚Äî it remembers what you‚Äôve asked (inconsistently).  
- üëÅÔ∏è **Sentience Illusion** ‚Äî whispers appear without input, UI flickers and glitches, ambient presence.  
- üé® **Polished UI** ‚Äî sleek, futuristic web design with subtle timewarps and glitch overlays.

## Visual Style

- Dark, polished UI with neon aqua, magenta, and violet accents.  
- Glassmorphism panels, gradients, volumetric glow.  
- Subtle glitch overlays, time distortions, particle effects.  
- Feels cinematic, futuristic, and alive ‚Äî not retro.

## How It Works

- **Frontend**: Next.js + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion (animations & polish).  
- **Visual Effects**: Three.js / WebGL shaders for glitch, particles, and timewarps.  
- **AI Assets**:  
  - Images & Videos: Stable Diffusion (Automatic1111 + ControlNet / Deforum).  
  - Audio: custom-trained TTS model for Oracle‚Äôs voice.  
  - Text: curated responses + prompt leaks, expandable with local LLMs (GPT4All, llama.cpp).  
- **Hosting**: Cloudflare Pages / GitHub Pages (static, no login required).
